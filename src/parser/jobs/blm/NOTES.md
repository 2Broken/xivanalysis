## BLM Things

Letting procs drop

Clipping gcds. Include fast-cast B3/F3

Downtime between casts

Ending ice with hard thunder

- T3inUI.js keeps track of that but not if F4s are being lost because of it.
 
Skipping B4 and getting less than 5 F4 next rotation

Not getting 6+ F4 per rotation with B4

Extraneous F1s per rotation

Missing Sharp or Triple uses

Missing LL uses. Ideally based on fight duration and inactive fight segments

LL vs Circle of Power buff comparison

Scathe use outside of finishers

Overwritten or missing Fouls
- is in and should also work. More testing is appreciated.
- also added tracking of dropped fouls due to dropping eno

Missing aoe buffs compared to party

Eno dropping
- is in and should work. Needs probably more testing but I got rid of all the bugs I found
T4/T4p hitting 2 or less targets

Foul or Flare hitting 1 target when 2+ are active and in proximity
